# How do I contribute?

## What needs to be done?

Simply check the issue board! You may start a branch on an issue that isn't formally declared but this is usually a bad idea
in the case where someone else may be working on the same thing and there ends up being a conflict.

If you would like to add an issue, first make sure that no similar issue already exists. If one exists then simply add any
useful findings. When creating a new issue you will be given a template - please make use of these as they enforce 
descriptive and well thought out solutions/fixes.

## Making changes

Start by fork + cloning the project. Once you make an addition then make the pull request, easy! 

If you are a contributor then you may go the branching route. Prefix your branch as follows:
- `feat/` When the change is primarily an enhancement
- `fix/` When the change is primarily a bug fix
- `docs/` When the change is primarily adding documentation or code commenting

## Making a Pull Request

**Title**: No emojis in the title. This is a simple and concise header

**Body**: The body should be a concise, bulleted list describing changes made

All pull requests are _Squashed and Merged_ where the commit message is the title and the description is a 
list of bullet points describing the changes.

## Commit Messages
